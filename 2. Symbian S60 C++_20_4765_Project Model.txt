Object: This example "adventure" application uses essentially the same modeling concepts as the S60 Python phone examples. S60 native C++ code can be generated from the top MenuApp graph in this project. <Note> 20_4815

Object: This simple example shows the menu and view structure of the S60 SDK example of menu controls, and its subgraph shows a simple example application. <Note> 20_4849
	Documentation: This simple example shows the menu and view structure of the S60 SDK example of menu controls, and its subgraph shows a simple example application.
Object: This example requires Nokia Series 60 SDK FP1, Visual C++ 6.0 SP3, Perl 5.005_07. After installing them you must manually map U: to the Symbian drive, e.g.:
subst u: C:\Symbian\6.1\Series60
and copy *.BMP from U:\Series60Ex\menu\aif to U:\ExMenu\aif
You can then use the Build button in the MenuApp diagram. <Note> 20_5069
