	Pen down?: T
	Distance: 2
Object: The Turtle language is based on the concepts of Logo Turtle graphics, and generates code to run on Python. The language gives commands to a turtle with a pen, which draws lines along its path as it moves Forward and Backward, and turns Left and Right. The commands can be repeated by enclosing them in a For loop, whose variable can be used as a parameter in those commands. <Note [Turtle]> 21_999
