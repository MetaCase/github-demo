Graph: Time <WatchApplication> 9_374
	Application name: Time
	Documentation: Application for showing the current time. Allows editing of hours, minutes and seconds. While we're running on a PC, we don't want to set the real time, so these changes apply to the clockOffset and hence to the clockTime perceived by the running watch.
