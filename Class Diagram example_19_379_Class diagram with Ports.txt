Object: Dynamic ports
A template uses the attributes in the class as dynamic ports: colored balls on the edge of the symbol, which can be connected to. A second template displays the attribute texts in the same order. <Note> 19_1714

Object: Movable dynamic ports
Turn on 'Allow moving of ports' in both templates in the symbol and save it, then you can reorder an attribute by selecting its role and dragging it.
    See Movable Dynamic Ports graph or EAST-ADL and SDL projects for more examples of movable dynamic ports. <Note> 19_1719
