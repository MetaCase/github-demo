	Description: State Transition Diagram can be used to highlight the time-dependent behaviour of a system. Process in Data Flow Diagram can be exploded to State Transition Diagram, or Class in Object Model can be exploded to State Transition Diagram as well.

The major components of the diagram are states and arrows representing state changes.

		Description: Transition describes a change between states. Transition has three properties: condition, action, and documentation. A condition is some event in the external environment that the system is capable detecting. Thus, a condition causes a change from one state to another. It can typically be a signal or a keystroke. An action is a response either back for the external environment or to the system itself. Therefore, as a part of the change an action defined the function to be performed in the transition. Documentation is reserved for entering additional information about the transition.
