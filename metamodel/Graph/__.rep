/* 
	Useful for concatenating strings to assign to a variable,
	or elsewhere where only a single command can be used. 
	Rather than the longer:  variable 'a' write 'prefix' $b 'suffix' close
	can write short, clear:  $a = __('prefix' $b 'suffix')
	Note this is not multiple arguments, just one formed by multiple commands.
