Graph Type
==========================
Activity Diagram
	Activity diagram is a special kind of state diagram: all or most of the states are action nodes and transitions are triggered by completion of actions in the source states.

==========================
Object Types
==========================
Start
	A start denotes to the starting point of the state transition diagram. It is represented by a black dot.
	---------------------------------------------
Action
	An action is an executable activity node that is the fundamental unit of executable functionality in an activity, as opposed to control and data flow among actions.
	---------------------------------------------
	Action name: String
	Documentation: Text
Accept event
	Accept event action is an action that waits for the occurrance of an event meeting specified conditions.
	---------------------------------------------
	Action name: String
	Documentation: Text
	Timed?: Boolean
Send signal
	Send signal is an action that creates a signal instance, transmits it to the target object, where it may cause the firing of transition or execution of an activity.
	---------------------------------------------
	Action name: String
	Documentation: Text
Decision
	Decision is used to extend a simple transition to describe multiple output transitions. A decision may include a condition or each output transition may have own conditions (similar to simple transitions). 
	---------------------------------------------
	Condition: Text
Partition
	Partition name: String
Package
	A package is used for grouping elements and organizing models: a system may be thought of as a single high-level package included other model elements and other packages. Depending on the graph type used a package can contain a set of use cases, classes or other packages. Each package is represented with a folder symbol with name of the package inside the symbol and steretotype of the package above the symbol.
	---------------------------------------------
	Package name: String
	Stereotype: String
	Documentation: Text
Object [UML]
	An object denotes to an instance of a class. An object has six properties: name of instance, name of class of that instance, multiplicity, it's attribute values, stereotype and documentation.
	---------------------------------------------
	Object name: String
	Class: Class [UML]
	Multiple?: Boolean
	Variables: OrderedCollection (Variable [UML])
	Stereotype: String
	Documentation: Text
Stop
	A stop denotes to the end of the state transition diagram. It is represented by two circles.
	---------------------------------------------
Flow stop
	Flow stop ends all flows in an activity.
	---------------------------------------------
Note text
	Note is a special object for adding additional text anywhere in the graphs. It can be linked to another design objects with a note connection relationship.
	---------------------------------------------
	Note text: Text
	Stereotype: String

==========================
Relationship Types
==========================
Control flow
	Control flow describes the sequencing of behaviours that does not involve the flow of objects.
	---------------------------------------------
Object flow
	Object flow describes which objects are input or output to action nodes.
	---------------------------------------------
Dependency [UML]
	Dependency show client-supplier links dependencies between logical elements. The client, pointed by an arrow, is dependent in some way on the client.
	---------------------------------------------
	Stereotype: String
	Alias name: String
Note connection
	Note connection can be used to link a note text to related element in a model. A note connection is represented by a grey line.

State Machine Diagram
	A state machine diagram is used to show the state space of an instance of a class, the events that cause a transition from one state to another, and the actions that result from a state change.

Class [UML]
	An class describes a group of objects with similar properties (attributes), common behaviour (operations), common relationships to other objects, and common semantics. Class is represented as a box with three parts each including different properties. Class name is in the first part of the class box toghether with a stereotype. List of attributes are in the second part, and list of operations are in the last box. Class can be characterized according to:
	- package they belong
	- whether it is abstract
	- whether it is persistent
	- how the element may be overridden by the subclass. Values: virtual - fully defined and may be overridden, leaf - fully defined and may not be overridden, deferred - protocol only defined and must be overridden, extensible - may be extended but not overridden
	- role (model, view, controller)
	- template parameters
	- constraints
	- invariant information
	- derivation rules
	- responsibility
	- documentation, and 
	- simple symbol? to choose whether the whole class symbol is shown or only class name and possible template parameters.
	
	Each attribute in a list field is used for entering in more detail characteristics of an attribute. These include: 
	- attribute name
	- data type
	- initial value
	- stereotype
	- visibility (public, private, or protected)
	- scope (class, instance, or class-instance)
	- access for the value
	- derived? to inform that the actual value is derived
	- persistent?
	- constraints
	- documentation
	
	A operation is a specific behavior that an object is responsible for exhibiting. Operation list field is used for adding in more detail specifications of an operation. Each operation can be specified by:
	- name
	- parameters containing parameter name, type and default value
	- return type (i.e. possibly object to be returned)
	- method body or operation specification
	- whether the operation can be overridden (virtual - fully defined and may be overridden, leaf - fully defined and may not be overridden, deferred - protocol only defined and must be overridden, extensible - may be extended but not overridden)
	- stereotype (e.g for Smalltalk protocols)
	- visibility (public, private, or protected)
	- operation type (class or instance)
	- preconditions
	- postconditions
	- documentation
