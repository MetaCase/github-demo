Process/Organization Matrix
	Once business processes has been identified Process/Organization Matrix is used to relate processes to the organizational structure. Essentially, Process/Organization Matrix illustrates who makes decisions in each of the processes. The matrix consist of two axis, in which first one includes all the relevant business processes and the second one includes various organizational units. These two objects are related to each other through various levels of responsibility (i.e. major responsibility, major involvement and some involvement in the process).

Object Types
==========================
Business process
	A business process represents a function which produce some products (material or services) to other parts of the company or the chain. A business process is represented by a rectangle with a horizontal line inside it. Business process has five properties: name, process type, value adding, costs and documentation. Specifically, process type is used to specify the business processes in more detail. The process type can be selected from predefined types, (inbound, operations, outbound, sales, service, delivery, development, administration) or by entering your own process type. A value adding is used to specify results of the process, i.e. how much it has added the value to the chain. A cost is used to enter the expenses of a process.

Data Flow Diagram
	Data flow diagrams are perhaps the most well known and widely used modelling technique. Their basic idea is to represent the flow of data through a system.
	
	The objects in this method are 'process', 'store' and 'external' and a relationship between these objects is 'Flow'.
