Graph Type
==========================
Process/Entity Matrix
	Process/Entity Matrix is used to illustrate the overall picture of the required information by linking it to the appropriate business processes. The linking is specified further with data usage, i.e. is the data created, used, updated or deleted by the process.

Object Types
==========================
Business process
	A business process represents a function which produce some products (material or services) to other parts of the company or the chain. A business process is represented by a rectangle with a horizontal line inside it. Business process has five properties: name, process type, value adding, costs and documentation. Specifically, process type is used to specify the business processes in more detail. The process type can be selected from predefined types, (inbound, operations, outbound, sales, service, delivery, development, administration) or by entering your own process type. A value adding is used to specify results of the process, i.e. how much it has added the value to the chain. A cost is used to enter the expenses of a process.
	---------------------------------------------
	Name: String
	Type: String
	Value adding: String
	Costs: String
	Documentation: Text
Entity
	Entities are objects about which the system stores information. Examples of entities are 'order', 'customer' and 'worker'. An entity is represented by a solid rectangle with a name inside it. Entity has two properties: name and documentation. An entity name is reserved for entering the identifying name of the entity and documentation for entering additional information about entity.
	---------------------------------------------
	Entity name: String
	Documentation: Text

Relationship Types
==========================
Data usage
	Data usage defines in more detail the relationship between the entity and business process. Data usage can be based either on:
	- data creation in which process creates an entity,
	- read in which process uses information about an entity,
	- update in which process modifies information about an existing entity, or
	- delete in which process can remove an entity.

Data Flow Diagram
	Data flow diagrams are perhaps the most well known and widely used modelling technique. Their basic idea is to represent the flow of data through a system.
	
	The objects in this method are 'process', 'store' and 'external' and a relationship between these objects is 'Flow'.

Entity Relationship Diagram
	Entity Relationship Diagrams are used to specify the data structures of the system, e.g. to model the contents of the data stores in more detail. 
	
	The objects in this method are 'entity' and 'attribute'. Entities can be related to each other with 'relationship'.

Person
	Person is used to describe developers involved in a project (i.e. attached to the project model) and authors of developed models. Person can be characterized with a name, e-mail address, and with a contact address.
