	Object name: Entity
	__UUID: Q1p3D1+PTqGbpr7AVk5HHg
	Properties: 
	Occurrence: N
	Description: Entities are objects about which the system stores information. Examples of entities are 'order', 'customer' and 'worker'. An entity is represented by a solid rectangle with a name inside it. Entity has two properties: name and documentation. An entity name is reserved for entering the identifying name of the entity and documentation for entering additional information about entity.

	Description: A store acts as a repository for data. Thus, a store allows you to define parts of the system where you need data stored between processes. A store is symbolized by a rounded rectangle where the name of the store is shown inside the symbol. Store has two properties: store name and documentation.
Object: Relationship <Object [GOPRR]> 14_1372
	Object name: Relationship
	__UUID: JIMUV7mKSxGP2vIL622CNw
	Properties: 
	Occurrence: N
	Description: A relationship describes the connections between at least two entities. An example of a relationship is 'belong' which connects entity 'workers' to entity 'departments'. A relationship is represented by a solid diamond with a name inside the symbol. Relationship has name and documentation as properties, as well as cardinality, that specifies the connections between entities and relationships. The cardinality can be selected either from one of defaults (0,1,M) or by entering some other values.

	Description: A module describes a task performed in a process. Examples of modules are tasks like 'get record', 'write record' or 'display output'. A module is represented by a rectangle with a name of the module inside the symbol. Module has two properties: module name, and documentation. The documentation field can be used to enter additional information about module or to specify the rules of the module in more detail. For example,to include executable instructions like e.g.:  IF record = EOF THEN CALL module C ELSE ...
