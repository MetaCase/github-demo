This example illustrates the ability to create dynamic, interactive models which automatically update based on changes to the existing design.  

As new relationships are drawn between screens (objects) the model automatically adds the necessary buttons to the configuration. Also, when the layout is modified, the order of the buttons also updates (in this example, based on the vertical order). 

Select the Settings object and move it to the bottom. The buttons in the Start object (on the left) will update.

This ability to automatically update and respond to changes makes it fast and easy to add new features, or modify exisiting ones, with MetaEdit+.
