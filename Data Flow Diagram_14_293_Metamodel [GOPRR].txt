Object: External Store <Object set [GOPRR]> 14_2565
	Objects: External Store
	Object: External <Object [GOPRR]> 14_1620
		Object name: External
		__UUID: XWyB1ceMSy+nfmLH4QZtaA
		Properties: 
		Occurrence: N
		Description: An external is an object which represents a source or a destination of data flows in the modelled system. Thus, externals which e.g. are 'customers', 'suppliers', 'employees' are considered to be outside the system but still either accepting or providing data to it or both. An external is represented by a solid square with a name of the external inside the symbol. External has two properties: external name and documentation.

		Description: A store acts as a repository for data. Thus, a store allows you to define parts of the system where you need data stored between processes. A store is symbolized by a rounded rectangle where the name of the store is shown inside the symbol. Store has two properties: store name and documentation.
